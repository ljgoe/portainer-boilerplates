#+title: Boilerplates
#+description: A boilerplate is any written text that can be reused in new contexts or applications without significant changes to the original.


- This repo is used for all my boilerplates, note i did clone these and will make them my own as needed
- At the moment it's mainly docker-compose files and ansible playbooks used for my homelab.
- Every docker-compose file has its own README that explains every single line of code.
- For some of the files there are requirement and/or usage guides. These will also be in the README.
- Many of these need to be adapted to your person use-case. These variable are marked with ~< >~.
- At the moment I prefer to use Nginx Proxy Manager but most of these docker-compose files are already set up for Traefik. If you don't plan on using Traefik, just remove the Traefik labels, remove the proxy network and in some cases re-add the the ~ports: -...:...~
